The effective executive
Communication is crucial, you have to know how to say what you want, and for this there are many options and you should use as many as possible. Analogy, building a wire frame , do mock ups
2) Research your clients. Who are them? What they want?
3) Consistent plan to deal with resource allocation and deallocation
4) Organize teams around functionality, not job functions
5) Too much time without conclusion. You failed. Stop it.

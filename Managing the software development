In order to manage the software development properly and effectively, first you need to establish ground rules and delegate part of the project accordingly. In addition, you also need to automate the process. Conducting project-wide testing while coding is another important thing you should keep in mind.

Lastly, you need to look through the eyes of the sponsor when assessing project. The perception of success is what counts and you need to know how to delight the sponsor.

A good programmer needs to value craftsmanship and take responsibility for the defects/errors of his/her software. Being a good programmer is like being an artist; if youâ€™re not committed to it you should not be doing it. 

Good programmers are early adopters of new technologies. Given the dynamic nature of the field, they should enjoy taking on new challenges; and should generally accept a lower fee for the opportunity to work with a new language. 

Similarly, they must also be fast adapters to new languages/tools/techniques and methods. Consequently they are jacks-of-all-trades, familiar with a broad range of languages. 
Another key trait of a good programmer is an inquisitive nature: they should be asking targeted, detailed questions on the software that they are examining or on the software you are asking them to build. They should be critical thinkers, and adapt features and tools that they have come across to the specific project they are tackling.

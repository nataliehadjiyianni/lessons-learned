The Connextra method is an important tool to help non-tech savvy individuals (i.e. business school students) speak "programmer".
The method combines "user stories" with agile software development as a basis for defining functions of a business system or software buildout. 
The method is broken out into three steps:
1) Role: As a ________ (i.e. customer, purchaser, etc)
2) Feature: I want to _________ (i.e. check order status, review purchase, see account status etc)
3) Benefit: So that _________ (i.e. I know when product will be delivered, I can see how much I spent etc)

Here is a [link to wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story), which lays out User Stories and the Connextra method in more detail: 

So, next time you decvide to build out software... if your whiteboard looks like the one below, then congrats!

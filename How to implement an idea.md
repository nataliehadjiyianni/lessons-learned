Nowadays if you have an idea (tech related) and you want to implement it, you can't that easily!!
When you are a coder, you can make the computer do exactly what you want; when youâ€™re a founder, you need people to understand your idea and implement it for you, you have to trust that people implement correctly, timely and cost efficienlty.
You don't have any control unless you have a clear structure to rely on, to:
1. Assess programmer qualities
2. Attract good programmer
3. Manage software development

In that sense the last class provided the basis to create a clear framework and reference points to go in the real world and not be completely lost!

Some of the tips, such as hire somebody that other developer respect or test coder on the less used lunguage (lisp, closure, etc.), become part of a check list every founder shoud have when is looking for someone to help him implent his/her idea!
